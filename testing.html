    <h3> Unit Testing </h3>
    
    <p> To unit test the cloud database and its schema the database can be built in myUK MySQL database or in another third party 
      RDBMS software such as MySQL (which is free and open-source!). By doing this, the team can unit test our database and its schema independent 
      of the mobile and desktop teams as the applications they are developing will be the actual processes storing and retrieving information to and 
      from the database. This allows us to develop queries to be used by them that are needed for the work these applications do. Therefore, our team 
      does not have to wait on these teams to develop their user-interfaces and front-in portions of apps to test. When these 
      applications are ready to begin testing database connectivity and querying, we then supply our results to them having confidence that 
      they work and pull / push the correct data.
