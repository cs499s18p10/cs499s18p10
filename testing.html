    <h1>Testing</h1>
    
    <h3> Unit Testing </h3>
    
    <p> To unit test the cloud database and its schema the database can be built in myUK MySQL database or in another third party 
      RDBMS software such as MySQL (which is free and open-source!). By doing this, the team can unit test our database and its schema independent 
      of the mobile and desktop teams as the applications they are developing will be the actual processes storing and retrieving information to and 
      from the database. This allows us to develop queries to be used by them that are needed for the work these applications do. Therefore, our team 
      does not have to wait on these teams to develop their user-interfaces and front-in portions of apps to test. When these 
      applications are ready to begin testing database connectivity and querying, we then supply our results to them having confidence that 
      they work and pull / push the correct data.
    <p>
      
    <p> The MySQL commands to build the database and its schema in myUK or another open-source DBMS software can be found at the following link: <a href="buildDB.html">Commands</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The result of running the above commands is that the database and its tables should be built in the relational database software used!
    </p>
    
    <p> After building the database and its tables you can then run the following commands to insert "test" data into the 
      tables to run queries on the database and test its capabilities: <a href="insertData.html">Commands</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The result of running the above commands is that the database and its tables are filled with "test data" so that initial queries 
      needed for system operation can be developed!
    </p>
    
    <p> After inserting the "test" data into the database the following commands can be run to query the database and ensure the 
      schema is correct: <a href="queryDatabase.html">Commands</a>
    </p>
    
    <p> Note that the above are basic queries to ensure the database tables are set up correctly, "test" data has been inserted into them,
      and that functionality is good. As the mobile and desktop applications are further developed more advanced queries will be 
      designed to process the necessary data needed for these applications to function.
    </p>
    
    <h3> Integration / Function Testing </h3>
    
    <p> To function test the database we developed the higher-level SQL commands needed by both the mobile and desktop applications 
      to interact with and send / receive data from the cloud. We again tested these commands directly on our "test" database built with 
      either myUK or an open-source relational database software. This allowed our team to build the queries needed by mobile and desktop 
      independent of these systems and their progress. By doing this our team can ensure the queries themselves work properly, 
      have the correct syntax, and process the necessary data. Then, when mobile and desktop are ready to add these queries to the back-end
      of their applications, we can confidently hand them off knowing that their execution should be sound if communication works properly.
    </p>
    
    <p> Therefore, as mentioned above, these queries can be tested directly on the non-cloud relational database developed in the 
      unit testing portion of this page.
    </p>
    
    <p> The SQL queries / commands primarily used by the mobile application involve sending data to the cloud and storing that information
      there. Mobile is currently set up in a way that it doesn't retrieve any data from the cloud except for the independent car 
      spec database. The following are some commands used by mobile to send data to the cloud and have that information stored there 
      (note that more commands will most likely be developed in the future as the mobile team progresses and seeks to expand their 
      application's capabilities): <a href="mobileCommands.html">Mobile Commands</a>
    </p>
    
    <p> The SQL queries / commands primarily used by the desktop application involve retrieving data from the cloud necessary in analyzing 
      and re-creating crash scenes. This will involve pulling down vehicle and case data for specific cars and occupants and on specific 
      dates and times. Queries for checking work groups will also be developed to ensure that only investigators analyzing certain accidents 
      can access their information. This is necessary as the data we are dealing with is sensitive and must be kept secure so that only authorized 
      users have access to the data needed for their jobs. The following are some commands used by desktop to retrieve data from the cloud 
      and view it within the desktop application (note that more commands will most likely be developed in the future as the desktop team 
      progresses and seeks to expand their application's capabilities): <a href="desktopCommands.html">Desktop Commands</a>
    </p>
    
    <h3> System Testing </h3>
    
    <p> To do the system testing the AWS cloud relational database must be used versus the test database on myUK. This is required as 
      the overall system of our project consists of the cloud database, the mobile application, and the desktop application. To do the 
      system test the SQL queries developed in the integration / function testing portion must be coded into the mobile and desktop 
      application backgrounds. This is required because the user will cause these queries to be processed by writing data to 
      the cloud from the mobile side or pulling data down from the cloud from the desktop side.
    </p>
    
    <p> To test the queries developed in the integration / function sections for the mobile application system a user must be able to 
      input information about the vehicle, occupants, case, etc. into a sheet. The user should then be able to send this data from the 
      scene to the cloud with the simple push of a button. To test the system either the cloud should be analyzed to ensure it 
      now contains this information. This can also be done by using the desktop application to pull down the corresponding case files and 
      examine it to ensure all data was stored correctly and can be accesses. In other words, if the queries tested in the 
      integration / function section work correctly on the test database, they should work on our cloud database if proper communication 
      between the cloud, desktop, and mobile applications all work. 
    </p>
    
    <p> The following diagram shows how the entire system should be tested for proper execution. Note that this diagram applies to 
      each of the queries developed in the integration / function testing section as well as potential future queries needed for mobile or 
      desktop.
    </p>

    <p> In other words, to system test our queries from the integration / function testing section should be built in to the mobile and 
      desktop applications. These applications can then be used to send and retrieve information from the cloud database. 
      If mobile can send data to the database and desktop can then pull that data down into the CAD program, then our system should work 
      correctly as the queries themselves have already been tested in the integration / function testing section. So basically, this level 
      of testing is ensuring communication works and that data can be transmitted accurately between mobile, the cloud, and desktop. 
    </p>
    
    <h3> Customer / User Testing </h3>
    
    <p>
      For customer and user testing we plan to have our customer have the mobile and desktop applications in hand and fully functional. 
      Our customer should be able to access the mobile app and input case information from a crash scene. After inputting case 
      information, the user should be directed to input vehicle information for cars involved in the accident as well as occupant 
      information for occupants in those vehicles. Finally, the user should be directed to a screen where they can input the reference 
      information consisting of both witness notes and their own personal notes. The user should then be able to send all this 
      information up to the cloud database where it is stored.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      After using the mobile application to store the data, the customer should then be able to use the desktop application to access 
      that specific case just input and all its information. The user should be able to view and analyze case details, vehicle 
      information, occupant data, and reference details. This info should be available immediately and should be accurate based on what 
      was input from the mobile side. If the customer can go through this entire process with the data being accurate and the products 
      being easy to use, then we will have achieved our goal for the semester!
