      This week my focus was to prepare the Entity-Relationship diagram to establish a foundation for the database we are to implement.  Daniel Huffman and I collaborated
      to develop a rough draft. Our goal was to establish the tables we would need to store and manage necessary data.  The attributes in these tables are likely to change some
      throughout the project, however, we were able to set up the necessary details to help get us started. This was very helpful because it allowed us to communicate with our customer about our approach. 
      This fundamental process also helped illustrate for the customer the attributes we had determined to be neccessary. We also had some architecture questions that needed to be hashed out with Mr. Flamm.

      I also communicated within our group as well with Mike.  During our meeting on Thursday I approached Mike with our ideas, as well as inquired about the architecture that our group had previously discussed.
      I have also communicated with the desktop, and the mobile side of this project to try to obtain a cohesiveness within our projects.
