    <h1>Ryan Parsley's Weekly Activity on Project 10</h1>

      This week my focus was to prepare the Entity-Relationship diagram to establish a foundation for the database we are to implement.  Daniel Huffman and I collaborated
      to develop a rough draft. Our goal was to establish the tables we would need to store and manage necessary data.  The attributes in these tables are likely to change some
      throughout the project, however, we were able to set up the necessary details to help get us started. This was very helpful because it allowed us to communicate with our customer about our approach. 
      This fundamental process also helped illustrate for the customer the attributes we had determined to be neccessary. We also had some architecture questions that needed to be hashed out with Mr. Flamm.

      I also communicated within our group as well with Mike.  During our meeting on Thursday I approached Mike with our ideas, as well as inquired about the architecture that our group had previously discussed.
      I have also communicated with the desktop, and the mobile side of this project to try to obtain a cohesiveness within our projects.

      This week our focus was to finalize the design of our database.  We wanted to keep scalability in mind for future use of our software for the customer, Mr. Flamm. By separating some of our tables we were able to 
       plan for expansion to the database.  Daniel and I were responsible for implementing the changes and to our design and finalizing our Entity-Relationship diagram.  I also coordinated with the desktop group to make sure
        our design would translate  easily to their design. I also requested that the desktop team allow us to see their progess so that we can make sure we are all on the same page.  I also worked on getting our data from our customer 
        as we were unable to initially see the data due to format issues.
