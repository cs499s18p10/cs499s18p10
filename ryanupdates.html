    <h1>Ryan Parsley's Weekly Activity on Project 10</h1>

    <h3>February 5, 2018 - February 11, 2018</h3>

    <p>
      This week my focus was to prepare the Entity-Relationship diagram to establish a foundation for the database we are to implement.  Daniel Huffman and I collaborated
      to develop a rough draft. Our goal was to establish the tables we would need to store and manage necessary data.  The attributes in these tables are likely to change some
      throughout the project, however, we were able to set up the necessary details to help get us started. This was very helpful because it allowed us to communicate with our customer about our approach. 
      This fundamental process also helped illustrate for the customer the attributes we had determined to be neccessary. We also had some architecture questions that needed to be hashed out with Mr. Flamm.

      <p>
      I also communicated within our group as well with Mike.  During our meeting on Thursday I approached Mike with our ideas, as well as inquired about the architecture that our group had previously discussed.
      I have also communicated with the desktop, and the mobile side of this project to try to obtain a cohesiveness within our projects.

      This week our focus was to finalize the design of our database.  We wanted to keep scalability in mind for future use of our software for the customer, Mr. Flamm. By separating some of our tables we were able to 
       plan for expansion to the database.  Daniel and I were responsible for implementing the changes to our design and finalizing our Entity-Relationship diagram.  I also coordinated with the desktop group to make sure
        our design would translate easily to their design. I also requested that the desktop team allow us to see their progess so that we can make sure we are all on the same page. I also worked on getting our data from our customer 
        as we were unable to initially see some of the data due to format issues.

      This week I was a part of developing an instance of our database on the Amazon Web service platform.  I successfully downloaded the MYSQL workbench that is reccomended to use with the AWS database system.  I also developed
      the approach we will be using regarding our "offline" services.  I decided we will actually implement two separate databases.  This is pivotal because one database will require user priveledges and one database will be free to any end user
      of the application.  I met with Mike Flamm to discuss our design and to address the concerns I had for user priveledges. I also assisted in writiing code for our project webpage specifically the size and effort esitmation section.

      <h3>February 26, 2018 - March 4, 2018</h3>
      <p>
         To start the week, we arranged a meeting with our customer that encouraged the three independent groups to be a cohesive unit while finishing the projects.  Along with my team, it was my responsibility to communicate our goals and design features to the other two groups.
          My focus this week was to ensure that we created appropriate tables for our second database. This database is more robust in that there are seven tables that are linked through specific keys which will allow our users to query,update, and delete
         necessary data. I created the tables for each entity in our database, along with the required attributes to represent each enitity.  During this week I was also responsible for scheduling our appointment with PresentationU. I was also tasked with 
         helping with the development of our slide presentation for our project.  Also, while keeping a focus on our groups presentation, I focused on my portion of the presentation which centered on the developmental process of our database and its design. I 
          participated in a trial run with PresentationU and recieved feedback which will help me with my final presentation.

       <h3>March 5, 2018 - March 18, 2018</h3>
      <p>
       This week was the week of our presentation for the professor and class.  I spent most of my time over this period focusing on my presentation for our group.  I helped in creating and managing the slides with the group.  I rehearsed my part of the presentqtion to  make sure
          I was able to perform at a high level for the group. After the meeting with Mike this week y focus has been to load and adjust the database with the necessary keys.  We are primarily focused in the upcoming weeks to establish a connection with the software and the mobile side of this encompassing
          project. We presented our project to the class and recieved positive feedback.
