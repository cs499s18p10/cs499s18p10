   <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h3>What is the Delta V Innovations Inc. Senior Design Database Project?</h3>
    <p>
      The Delta V Innovations Inc. Senior Design Database Project is one of three seperate projects being implemented for customer 
      Mike Flamm, founder of Delta V Innovations Inc. The purposes behind these projects are as follows: a server/database stored 
      on the cloud to hold crash scene and investigative data, a mobile app used in the field to collect crash scene data and communicate
      with the cloud database and desktop application, and a desktop application functioniing as a type of CAD program capable of 
      reconstructing crash scenes and communicating with the mobile app as well as cloud database. Altogther, the purpose of these
      projects is to develop systems to analyze valuable and enormous crash scene data sets and variables to determine not only how 
      an accident occurred, but more importantly why. By analyzing conditions such as tire wear, traffic flow, time of day, weather
      conditions, etc. this system seeks to help authorities paint a more accurate picture of where and why accidents are occuring in 
      the hope of improving conditions to where these accidents occur at a significantly lower rate.

      More specifically, the project our team is focusing on is the cloud server and database. The purpose of this project is to create 
      a cloud database consisting of tables, attributes, and features that can store the crash scene information collected in the field.
      Currently, most of this information is currently being collected the old way, by paper and pencil, where it is then uploaded to the 
      in house database at the office. By converting these databases to cloud systems, field workers would then be able to upload the data 
      at the scene (through the mobile app), as well as access information already stored in the database to help in the crash scene 
      investigation and information collection. Our goal is to create a secure database cloud system capable of communication with both 
      the mobile app, as well as the desktop information. We seek to develop a SQL database capable of holding all necessary crash scene
      information, car information, user information, as well as other valuable data (such as tire wear, friction gradients, etc). We 
      also plan to develop SQL queries to be used on the mobile app and desktop sides that can be used to update information in the 
      database as well as pull data already stored there.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      By creating a cloud relational database management system (RDBMS), information can then be accessed more easily and much more quickly. 
      This would go a long way towards the analysis of crash scenes and aid in the investigative work that goes into determining <b> WHY </b>
      a crash has occurred and ways it could have been prevented. The user we are developing this project for is Mr. Mike Flamm as his 
      Delta V Innovations Inc. company.

    <p><b>Alex Polus:</b><br>
      A Senior at the University of Kentucky, Alex is interested in applications of computer science and machine learning in finance and smart 
      home technology. 
      
      Professionally, Alex spent a summer with Layered Insight, working on cybersecurity solutions for containers. Then, a yearlong internship
      with the Bluegrass Angels exposed him to venture finance and buy side entrepreneurship. He allowed that interest to flow into an opportunity
      with the Endowment of the Gatton College of Business and Economics, managing $2,200,000, successfully generating alpha relative to the S&P500.
      
      Finally, an REU sponsored by the National Science Foundation allowed alex the opportunity to work in the Networked Cyber-Physical Systems Lab, 
      developing an indoor mapping and navigation tool for the blind and visually paired. Alex's skills include object-oriented programming with C++, 
      Python and Swift, verilog, embedded systems programming, and AC circuit analysis. 
      
      Personally, Alex is very interest in health, wellness, and exercise. He enjoys motorsports, hiking, and has a particular interest in Basketball.
