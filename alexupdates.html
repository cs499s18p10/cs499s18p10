      <h1>Alex Polus's Weekly Activity on Project 10</h1>

      <h3>February 5, 2018 - February 11, 2018</h3>

      <p>This week, Alex was primarily engaged with establishing this website. Alongside Dillon, the two generated all of these 
         pages and built out an effective structure to build upon for further updates and changes. Alex also communicated with 
         the customer and established an effective meeting over GoogleHangouts that everyone was able to attend, and that 
         clarified our requirements. Now, Alex plans to dive into Microsoft Azure and assisting with the structural design of
         the database
      </p>
     
     
      <h3>February 12, 2018 - February 19th, 2018</h3>
     
      <p>For the past week, Alex concerned himself with selecting a web services platform to publish a database on. After
         extensive research into AWS, Azure, and GoogleCloud, Alex found that AWS offered the best set of features. AWS offers
         the option for a configurable VPN around the database, which could be important down the line since this project
         incorporates government data, and the customer placed early emphasis on security. Furthermore, the group agreed that
         it would be easiest to go ahead and build the database on a company account, instead of using Azure's service because
         it's free to UK students, but having to transfer the database over to DeltaV at the end of the semester. AWS offered
         the best free-tier package, and appears to scale database pricing in the fairest way across competition.
      </p>
      <p>
         Paying mind to logistics, Alex also set up the meeting time and location with the customer, reserving a study room in
         William T. Young library so that the students could all be together on the video call with the customer. 
      </p>
      <p>
         Finally, Alex collaborated with Dillon to add the necessary updates to the website. He spent some good time breaking 
         down the rest of the semester into manageable chunks of work that the group could accomplish each week, and Dillon got
         that list published in calendar format to the website.    
      </p>
    
    <h3>February 20th - February 26th, 2018</h3>
    <p>
      Over the last seven days, Alex spent time with Daniel and Ryan configuring the database instance in AWS that the project 
      will be built upon. Alex also paid particular attention to features in the paid-tier of the database that may be useful in the future
      once the group moves past the initial testing phase. The customer made note of a desired pre-release date, so the group
      made plans to have certain features implemented by that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, outside of scheduling the normal weekly meeting with the customer and handing logistical details in regards
      to that, Alex spent additional time one on one with the customer developing some high-level plans for exactly how the mobile
      side, desktop side, and database will interract. That meeting concluded with making plans for all three teams to meet with
      the customer Monday the 26th in order to establish clear lines of communication between the three groups.
    </p>
    
    <h3>February 26th - March 5th</h3>
    <p>
      Since the last update, Alex has kept busy moving things forward. After collaborating with the group to develop 
      a quality presentation, Alex and the group gave a mock presentation to an employee of PresentationU in order to 
      get constructive feedback. Following that presentation, Alex continued to practice his presentation to get rid 
      of filler words and any anxious body language. Furthermore, the presentation appeared to be bogged-down by text 
      in certain areas, so Alex worked to revise the PowerPoint to feature more white space, and easier-to-swallow bullet 
      points instead of large sentences. In addition to the presentation, Alex spent time working on the website for 
      the project. Alex created the “User Scenarios” page, and added a good explanation of who would be using our database 
      when, and why. Finally, Alex spent time with Daniel troubleshooting ways to access the database, as it appears that 
      the group must explicitly list what IP addresses will be attempting to access it. However, the group believes this 
      may be a result of some misunderstanding of the database structure, and is working diligently to understand and 
      resolve that problem so that any device with the application downloaded can access the database through the mobile or 
      desktop application.
    </p>
    <h3>March 6th - March 19th</h3>
    <p>
      During this span of time, Alex was primarily concerned with providing a quality presentation to the class and Professor. 
      Alex spent a good amount of time spell checking the PowerPoint, assuring all content was correct, and working on it visually
      to ensure that there was a good balance of text to white space. Then, after a meeting with Mike, Alex worked with the rest of
      the group to make a specific plan as to how the group will be able to meet the requirements put forward by Mike for his 
      pre-release in April. Then, the group continued to load data into the public/reference database of public car knowledge. 
    </p>
    <h3>March 20th - March 26th</h3>
    <p>
      During this week, Alex had a variety of responsibilities within the group. First, he spent several hours working with
      Ryan and Daniel to consolidate the materials in the reference database. Then, a significant effort was made towards
      getting the database of accident cases in a reasonable form. The group was able to generate the three necessary tables,
      however there was an issue with foreign keys that prevented the group from being able to properly link the three. In
      regards to the customer, Alex handled logistics for the weekly meeting like usual, and spoke with the customer both in
      the normal meeting, as well as a cross-group meeting between all the developing teams and the customer to further 
      discuss interactions between UI's and the database.
    </p>
    <h3>March 26th - April 1st</h3>
    <p>
      Midway through the last week the group ran into a major problem. It was realized that the mobile application could not 
      properly communicate with the database without significant alterations to its existing structure. A variety of solutions
      exist, but there remained a question of what is the right way to solve the problem. Alex spent the week doing research
      into file sharing systems, php code, and NoSQL databases to try and get a grasp on how to best solve the problem and keep
      things moving forward so that the mobile app may be able to function properly.
    </p>
    <h3>April 2nd - April 8th</h3>
    <p>
      Alex spent a majority of his time in the last week in communcation with the customer and mobile team. There was an issue
      with variable alignment for the case database, and Alex and Nick from the mobile team discussed ways to fix this. In addition,
      Alex spent time making updates to the website and adding some testing information. Finally, Alex spent some time getting prepared
      for the coming group presentation. 
    </p>
    <h3>April 9th - April 16th</h3>
      This week was full of surprises, and solutions. Alex Spent the week corresponding with the Mobile team to obtain 
      a list of all variables they will be needing to store in the database. Earlier in the week along with Ryan, Alex found
      values the mobile app was trying to store that aren't available in the database. Furthermore, Alex assembled the 
      slidedeck for the database team to be ready to present on the 18th.
