    <h1>Mobile Application SQL Commands</h1>
    
    <h3> To use the database </h3>
    
    <p> USE MyDatabase; </p>
    
    <h3> To insert a new case into the "cases" table </h3>
    
    <p>
      The mobile app is setup to allow users to enter case information into the app. Users can then send that information up to the cloud
      after inputting all case data. The investigator name as well as user group will not be entered in on an app screen as this data 
      will be stored internally on the app based on who is logged in.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    INSERT INTO cases (name, roadConditions, street, city, state, zip, date, time, lighting, visibility, 
    temperature, weather, investigator, userGroup) <br>
    VALUES ('case name', 'road condition', 'street', 'city', 'state', 'zip', 'date',
    'time', 'lighting', 'visibility', 'temperature', 'weather', 'investigator', 1);
    </p>
    
    <h3> To insert a new vehicle into the "vehicle" table </h3>
    
    <p>
      The mobile app will also allow users to enter in vehicle information involved in accidents. Users can send that information up to 
      the cloud by completing the form on the app and inputting all vehicle information. The case ID will not be entered in on an app 
      screen as this data will be linked directly to the case the vehicle is involved in. Therefore, the app will be setup in a way that 
      investigators arrive at the scene and first input the case data into the app before being taken to a screen that allows them to input 
      the vehicle information.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      INSERT INTO vehicle (vin, model, year, make, speed, color, airbagDeploy, state, expiration, number, 
      caseID) <br>
      VALUES ('vin number', 'model', 'year', 'make', 'speed at time of accident', 'color', 'did the airbag deploy (y/n)',
      'state (license plate)', 'expiration (license plate)', 'number (license plate)', 'case ID');
    </p>
    
    <h3> To insert a new occupant into the "occupant" table </h3>
    
    <p>
      The mobile app will allow users to enter in occupant information involved in accidents. Users can send that information up to 
      the cloud by completing the form on the app and inputting all required information. The id will not be entered in on an app 
      screen as this data will be determined by the database itself (as new occupants are added to the table their id will be incremented 
      1 higher than the last occupant added). The vin number will also not be input as it will be linked directly to the vehicle 
      the occupant was in. Therefore, the app will be setup in a way that investigators input the vehicle data into the app before 
      the occupant data.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      INSERT INTO occupant (id, name, impairment, seatbeltUsage, type, phoneNumber, DOB, street, state, 
      city, zip, vin) <br>
      VALUES ('id', 'name', 'impairment', 'seatbel usage (y/n)', 'type', 'phone number', 'date of birth',
      'street (live on)', 'state (live in)', 'city (live in)', 'zip (live in)', 'vin number of the car in');
    </p>
    
    <h3> To insert a new reference into the "reference" table </h3>
    
    <p>
      The mobile app will allow investigators to enter in reference information for accidents. Users can send that information up to 
      the cloud by completing the form on the app and inputting all required information. The case id will not be entered in on an app 
      screen as this data will be linked to specific scene this investigator is documenting. Therefore, the app will be setup in a way 
      that investigators input the case data before being taken to a screen to input the reference data.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      INSERT INTO reference (caseID, witnessNotes, personalNotes) <br>
      VALUES ('case ID', 'witness notes', 'personal investigator notes');
    </p>
