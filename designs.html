    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Our cloud database is being created to be used with a mobile and desktop application that are being developed by two other CS Senior
      Design teams. The purpose of the entire system is for officers and analysts at crash scenes to use the mobile app to document and 
      photograph the scene. These images and information will then be uploaded to our AWS Cloud Database for storage, backup, and easy access.
      Then, after returning to the office, officers and analysts will then be able to open the desktop CAD application and access the 
      images and documentation from the scene of the incident. Overall, our cloud database will allow a more streamlined crash scene analysis 
      as this work is still done by pencil and paper. This system will also allow data to be sorted in ways that make it easier for system users
      to not only figure out how and crash occurred but why and how future accidents can be prevented.

    <p>
      To implement our database, we are using an Amazon AWS cloud relational database. We used ER Diagram and Relational Schemas to actually 
      design the database and develop tables, attributes, and their interconnections. Most of the data our customer has is currently stored
      in Excel type files. As AWS offers software to convert and upload Excel files into their databases this was used in uploading information.
      In later stages of the product SQL queries will be designed for the initial stages of the mobile and desktop applications to ensure they 
      can properly communicate with the database and send and retrieve information from it.

    <h3>Environment</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Amazon AWS Cloud Relational Database - Version: No specific level because once the data is in the cloud database Amazon handles version updates</li>
      <li>SQL:2016 (Database Programming Langauge)</li>
      <li>UKY Multilab Account - Version: UKY System in 2018 (Database and SQL command testing)</li>
      <li>ERDPlus - Version: Online Site used in 2018 (Database Design)</li>
      <li>Lucid Chart - Version: Online Site used in 2018 (Database Design)</li>
      <li>Microsoft Excel - Version: Excel 2016 (files containing data for database)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Entity-Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram)</b></p>

    <p>
      With our project being a cloud database design project the first thing our group set about doing was designing the overall layout of
      the database. This consisted of the various tables that are included, the attributes stored within them, and the interconnections
      (relationships) between tables and their attributes. One of the best ways to do this is to develop an Entity-Relationship Diagram
      (ER Diagram). After brainstorming our ideas and running them by our customer and what his expectations for the database are, here
      is our most recent database design in ER Diagram format. As you can see, ER Diagrams are powerful visual aids when it comes to database design
      as it's easy to see what is contained in the database, and the relationships that make it up.

    <p><b>Relational Schema</b></p>
    
    <p>
      After designing the ER Diagram, we then developed a Relational Schema for our database. Relational Schemas are another powerful tool
      when it comes to database design and layout. They are like ER Diagrams however they are in more of a table format, essentially the way
      data is stored in the database. Our most recent Relational Schema for our database design can be seen here:

    <p><b>Application Flowchart</b></p>
    
    <p>
      The following is a flowchart showing when our cloud database will be accessed and what information will be sent to or from it. 
      Overall, this helps to paint a clearer picture of the overall project and how each of the three separate teamâ€™s designs (projects) 
      will be incorporated together. As you can see, both the mobile application and desktop application query the database and need to 
      be able to communicate with it clearly and effectively.
