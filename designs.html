    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Our cloud database is being created to be used with a mobile and desktop application that are being developed by two other CS Senior
      Design teams. The purpose of the entire system is for officers and analysts at crash scenes to use the mobile app to document and 
      photograph the scene. These images and information will then be uploaded to our AWS Cloud Database for storage, backup, and easy access.
      Then, after returning to the office, officers and analysts will then be able to open the desktop CAD application and access the 
      images and documentation from the scene of the incident. Overall, our cloud database will allow a more streamlined crash scene analysis 
      as this work is still done by pencil and paper. This system will also allow data to be sorted in ways that make it easier for system users
      to not only figure out how and crash occurred but why and how future accidents can be prevented.
