    <h1>Screens</h1>
    
    <p>
      As our project is a cloud database we don't have typical "User Screens" like a mobile application or computer game would. 
      Instead, the screens that most users will see while accessing our project will come from the mobile and desktop application teams 
      that are designing the systems that will use and interact with our database. As these screens are still in development from these two 
      teams, instead we will show the backend of our cloud database system. These are the screens that the database administratorâ€™s and developers
      will see while interacting with our product while logged into the AWS Relational Cloud Database System. This is important because these 
      people will have access to an extraordinary amount of confidential data and these users need to know how to query the database, modify tables,
      and view database statistics.
