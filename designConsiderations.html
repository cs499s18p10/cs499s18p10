    <h1>Design Considerations</h1>
    
    <h3>The following are some of the issues we ran into throughout the semester while developing our project. </h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>Amazon AWS vs Microsoft Azure: </b>The first major issue we faced in our project was choosing a cloud database provider 
      to go with. With the two major options being Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure, we figured going with one of these systems would probably
      be our best option. After doing a significant amount of research on the pros and cons of each system, in the end we decided to go 
      with Amazon AWS. AWS offered numerous easy to use "get help" videos and a simplified extra layer of added security needed by our
      customer.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Designing the schema of the database: </b>The second major challenged faced by our team was designing the database. 
        We set about our design using the conventional methods, ER Diagrams and Relational Schemas. During this stage we first met with our 
        customer to talk about what type of data he was looking to collect, and the connections within it. We then developed an ER Diagram and 
        went back and forth with our customer modifying it until we arrived at a final layout he was pleased with. This design 
        continued to progress throughout the semester as new attributes were added and advancements were considered.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Part of a Multi-team project: </b>One of the toughest challenges facing our team was simply the overall 
        scale of the project. Throughout the semester our team had to ensure we were in near constant communication with both the desktop 
        and mobile application teams. This, in and of itself, was a challenge as it involved synchronization between over 10 separate 
        people. In the end we had to ensure our product was accessible and functioned correctly as it is the backend that allows both 
        applications to thrive.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Connection protocols with mobile application: </b>Connecting our product to desktop was simple as it involved 
        inserting a URL into their code, typical of the way databases are connected to products. However, connecting to the mobile application 
        was a different beast altogether. As mobile developed their product with <i>React Native</i> and other development libraries, our team 
        had to search long and hard for the correct way to make a connection. In the end we solved the problem with creating a separate PHP page 
        on our service to build a connection that <i>React Native </i> could then access.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Developing security protocols for the system: </b>As our customer plans to one-day use our design as a baseline for his business, 
        he wanted a sound-proof plan that would allow for security within his product as he will be dealing with 
        confidential information. Our product initiates security using a password at login. This password is then hashed at the 
        application level before being sent to and checked against the database for accuracy. Our team also came up with the idea of <i>Work-Groups
        </i> which are used to combine users into groups based on the specific cases they are analyzing and can access.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Inserting the initial vehicle specs data to the cloud: </b>Another challenge our team faced early in the semester was 
        in uploading a massive vehicle specs file to the cloud. To understand the size of this file, imagine a table with over 30 
        separate columns, attributes, containing everything from make and model, to number of doors, to the weight and height of the vehicle. 
        Then imagine this file having over 64,000 rows, a row for nearly every car make and model built since the 1970's. Inserting this data 
        and uploading it to the cloud was no simple task. In the end our team solved this issue using MySQL Workbench which actually 
        simplified this process. We found numerous videos demonstrating how initial data could be uploaded which were followed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Developing initial SQL queries used by both desktop and mobile: </b>One of the final issues our team ran into 
        was in developing the initial SQL queries needed for both desktop and mobile. Developing the initial queries themselves wasn't 
        difficult as 3 out 4 team members had taken a database class before. Instead, the difficult part was in testing the queries. 
        As testing our queries involved running them on either the desktop or mobile application against the cloud, this process was slow. 
        Our team had to wait for these other teams to work our queries into their system, and then wait for them to run them and hear back 
        from them. Once we realized this process was not optimal, we decided to build a replica of our database on one of our own 
        personal machines. This allowed queries to be easily developed and de-bugged in house. This simplified the process as we were 
        then able to hand over working queries to both teams.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>The following are some of the major changes we had to make to our design during implementation. </h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>The addition of new tables to the cloud database: </b>Will allow for even more specific data collection from officers in the field. 
        As the system progresses and goes into actual use, new tables will need to be added so the customer is able to collect the 
        specific information needed for his business to thrive. Additionally, over time as cars, vehicles, and roadways advance additional 
        information may need to be collected</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>The following are some of the restrictions and limitations to our design. </h3>
