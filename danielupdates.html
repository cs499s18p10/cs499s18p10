    <p>
       My main contribution this week was collaborating with Ryan Parsley to get a rough draft started on our entity relationship diagram or 
   ER diagram. <br>This involved determining the number of tables we thought we may need and trying to iron out some of the columns/attributes
   of these tables. <br> This was immensely helpful in determining what information we needed to request from Mike Flamm in order to continue 
   progress on this project. <br>There are still some tables that need to be fleshed out, but so far the planning is going along nicely. 
    </p> 
      I also did some coordinating within our group as well as with the client Mike.  During our meeting on Thursday I kept a record of 
  the information provided to us by Mike and generally what was discussed at the meeting.I was also part of the effort to organize all 
  three teams using Slack.
