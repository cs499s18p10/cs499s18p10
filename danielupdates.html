    <h1>Daniel Huffman's Weekly Activity on Project 10</h1>
       <h3>February 26, 2018 - March 4, 2018</h3>
    <p>
     My main accomplishment for this week was getting the database that holds all the car specs created. Once I created the database 
        I then researched software to for the most efficient way to populate it using the .csv file that Mike has provided. 
        Found the mysql workbench doesn't work well with loading information. HeidiSQL however, got the job done in record time.
        Database has been created and populated. Also attended a meeting of all three groups that was held in order to facilitate communication.

    This week we created an instance and development/test server. I began familiarizing myself with the MySQL workbench as this was my
    first time using this program. Created one table so far and work on finalizing the concepts for additional tables. I attended our 
    weekly meeting with Mike where we discussed structuring the user table and overall coordination between database, mobile and 
    desktop.

        For this week the contributions included continuing progress on the ER diagram as well as working on the rough draft
        of the the relational schema with Ryan Parsley. We met with Mike on Thursday to focus on how to set up the users for this program. 
        As a group we decided to go forward with AWS based on the information gathered by Alex. I also helped coordinate with the 
        other two teams to make sure we are all on the same page as far as goals and database experience.

       My main contribution this week was collaborating with Ryan Parsley to get a rough draft started on our entity relationship diagram or 
   ER diagram. This involved determining the number of tables we thought we may need and trying to iron out some of the columns/attributes
   of these tables.  This was immensely helpful in determining what information we needed to request from Mike Flamm in order to continue 
   progress on this project.There are still some tables that need to be fleshed out, but so far the planning is going along nicely.

      I also did some coordinating within our group as well as with the client Mike.  During our meeting on Thursday I kept a record of 
  the information provided to us by Mike and generally what was discussed at the meeting.I was also part of the effort to organize all 
  three teams using Slack.
