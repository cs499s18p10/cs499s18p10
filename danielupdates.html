Week 1( Feb 4th - Feb 11th)
    <p>
   My main contribution this week was collaborating with Ryan Parsley to get a rough draft started on our entity relationship diagram or 
   ER diagram. This involved determining the number of tables we thought we may need and trying to iron out some of the columns/attributes
   of these tables. This was immensely helpful in determining what information we needed to request from Mike Flamm in order to continue 
   progress on this project. There are still some tables that need to be fleshed out, but so far the planning is going along nicely.

	I also did some coordinating within our group as well as with the client Mike.  During our meeting on Thursday I kept a record of 
  the information provided to us by Mike and generally what was discussed at the meeting.I was also part of the effort to organize all 
  three teams using Slack.
