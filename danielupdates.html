    <h1>Daniel Huffman's Weekly Activity on Project 10</h1>
    <h3>February 12, 2018 - February 18, 2018</h3>
    <p>
        For this week the contributions included continuing progress on the ER diagram as well as working on the rough draft
        of the the relational schema with Ryan Parsley. We met with Mike on Thursday to focus on how to set up the users for this program. 
        As a group we decided to go forward with AWS based on the information gathered by Alex. I also helped coordinate with the 
        other two teams to make sure we are all on the same page as far as goals and database experience.

       My main contribution this week was collaborating with Ryan Parsley to get a rough draft started on our entity relationship diagram or 
   ER diagram. This involved determining the number of tables we thought we may need and trying to iron out some of the columns/attributes
   of these tables.  This was immensely helpful in determining what information we needed to request from Mike Flamm in order to continue 
   progress on this project.There are still some tables that need to be fleshed out, but so far the planning is going along nicely.

      I also did some coordinating within our group as well as with the client Mike.  During our meeting on Thursday I kept a record of 
  the information provided to us by Mike and generally what was discussed at the meeting.I was also part of the effort to organize all 
  three teams using Slack.
