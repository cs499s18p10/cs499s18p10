    <h1>Daniel Huffman's Weekly Activity on Project 10</h1>
          <h3>March 26, 2018 - April 1, 2018</h3>
     <p>
         This was a busy week for me. Worked on creating .csv files for most of the reference material that Mike has provided. Then
         I created tables to house the reference material that i have keyed so far. Also spent time talking to the other teams
         in order to help us coordinate. Finally I made sure that the code we have written down for mysql commands was up to date
         as well as our relational schema.
     </p>
     <h3>March 26, 2018 - April 1, 2018</h3>
     <p>
         Our main focus was trying to help the mobile team interact with the database. We are having issues having mobile access a
         php page stored on the same server as the database so that their application can access it. So Ryan and I met with mobile team 
         to discuss options, one of which my might be jumping to another platform other than AWS. Also I gave some assistance to
         Desktop in accessing the database, they are now able to query everything.  
     </p>
     <h3>March 19, 2018 - March 25, 2018</h3>
     <p>
     My focus this week was working on updating our documentation for our code as well as updating some of the tables in our database.
     This involved pretending to recreate the tables in mysql workbench so the mysql commands could be copied. I also helped update
     the relational schema so that would accurate. This was done with the help of the group and we still have some tables that 
     need to be worked on. Once this is done we plan on focusing on testing our database, in particular the table that contains the
     data concerning vehicle specs. 
     </p>
     
     <h3>March 5, 2018 - March 18, 2018</h3>
     <p>
       The past two weeks I focused on improving the database by consolidating tables. I also attended our 
       weekly meeting and reviewed some of the tables that other members of the group have created. I also
         tested some MySQL commands on our database, to ensure that everything could be accessed from 
         MySQL workbench. The main drive from here on what will be updating all the ER diagrams and 
         relational schema, as changes were made in the process of creating the actual database. Also will make 
         sure that the other teams have any assistance that they require. 
       <h3>February 26, 2018 - March 4, 2018</h3>
    <p>
     My main accomplishment for this week was getting the database that holds all the car specs created. Once I created the database 
        I then researched software to for the most efficient way to populate it using the .csv file that Mike has provided. 
        Found the mysql workbench doesn't work well with loading information. HeidiSQL however, got the job done in record time.
        Database has been created and populated. Also attended a meeting of all three groups that was held in order to facilitate communication.

     <h3>February 19, 2018 - February 25, 2018</h3>
    <p>
    This week we created an instance and development/test server. I began familiarizing myself with the MySQL workbench as this was my
    first time using this program. Created one table so far and work on finalizing the concepts for additional tables. I attended our 
    weekly meeting with Mike where we discussed structuring the user table and overall coordination between database, mobile and 
    desktop. 
     </p>
    <h3>February 12, 2018 - February 18, 2018</h3>
    <p>
        For this week the contributions included continuing progress on the ER diagram as well as working on the rough draft
        of the the relational schema with Ryan Parsley. We met with Mike on Thursday to focus on how to set up the users for this program. 
        As a group we decided to go forward with AWS based on the information gathered by Alex. I also helped coordinate with the 
        other two teams to make sure we are all on the same page as far as goals and database experience.
     </p>
    <h3>February 5, 2018 - February 11, 2018</h3>
 
    <p>
       My main contribution this week was collaborating with Ryan Parsley to get a rough draft started on our entity relationship diagram or 
   ER diagram. This involved determining the number of tables we thought we may need and trying to iron out some of the columns/attributes
   of these tables.  This was immensely helpful in determining what information we needed to request from Mike Flamm in order to continue 
   progress on this project.There are still some tables that need to be fleshed out, but so far the planning is going along nicely. 
    </p> 
      <p>
      I also did some coordinating within our group as well as with the client Mike.  During our meeting on Thursday I kept a record of 
  the information provided to us by Mike and generally what was discussed at the meeting.I was also part of the effort to organize all 
  three teams using Slack.
