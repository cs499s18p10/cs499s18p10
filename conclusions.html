    <h1>Conclusions</h1>
    
    <h3>A product ready for the app store</h3>
    <p>
      The group was given a time sensitive goal to be prepared by mid April to launch a functional application to
      the app store. In combination with hard work from the mobile and desktop teams, we were successfully able to 
      have a functional cross-platform application that can communicate with a robust database to both request and 
      store sensitive data. The database will be secure, scalable, affordable, and reliable. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Plans Moving Forward</h3>
    <p>
      This project was conducted in a way that will be very simple for future groups to understand and work with. 
      Built on Amazon Web Services, the platform will be constantly improving and well documented for ease of use. 
      The critical tools for design were HeidiSQL and MySQL Workbench which are free to download, and quick to learn. 
      However, in order to ensure quality in the future, the work was well documented both in an informal way on this
      website, as well as in a more formal documentation that will be provided to the customer to have on hand for 
      future engineers. With the flexible format of the database, future students and engineers will be able to improve
      the database with many of the suggestions in our "Future Enhancements" section, as well as a variety of other
      ideas they will undoubtedly come up with.

    <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
      <li><b>Efficiently managing a product as a team: </b>Everyone brought a different skillset to the table in our team, and 
          it was important for us to delegate work effectively as well as communicate with each other in order to achieve our
          goals. The group effectively used multiple channels of online communcation, worked to meet deadlines, and collaborated
          in a very efficient manner.</li>
      <li><b>Working on a project to market scale: </b>From the start, we knew that this product would be sent to market as soon
          as possible. As a result, we had to do work that could support the use of the public and a company poised to grow. 
          It was incredibly valuable to work on a project with the scope that this one had, in order to develop attention to 
          detail and the ability to document work at a professional level.</li>
      <li><b>Developing a functional database: </b>Our work did not come without hiccups. Building a real product came with a 
          variety of learning opportunities. Choosing a platform was key, but learning to use it had its initial challenges. 
          The group had to develop skills with a variety of third party software to integrate with AWS, as well as coordinate
          rdata collection from our customer's contacts. Working with a mobile and desktop team was another learning experience
          as the team had to phrase variables within the database in a logical way that would be easy to keep consistent across
          development teams.</li>
      <li><b>Working for a customer: </b>Although all of us have had other practical experience in engineering, experience
          working for a customer at an early stage company was great experience in building a system from scratch, to  very 
          specific design constraints and specifications. We were also able to develop a great degree of independence and 
          sense of ownership for our work since the customer was looking to us for technical guidance.</li>
    </ul>
