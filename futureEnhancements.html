    <h1>Future Enhancements</h1>
    
    <h3>The future enhancements to our system consist of 3 seperate projects. We will examine each project individually and consider 
      specific enhancements to it that would improve the overall system. Please note that the mobile and desktop application websites
      will provide even more specific future enhancements for their applications.
    </h3>
    
    <h3> Cloud Database - Our Team </h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>The addition of new tables to the cloud database: </b>Will allow for even more specific data collection from officers in the field. 
        As the system progresses and goes into actual use, new tables will need to be added so the customer is able to collect the 
        specific information needed for his business to thrive. Additionally, over time as cars, vehicles, and roadways advance additional 
        information may need to be collected</li>
      <li><b>The addition of new attributes to specific tables within the cloud database: </b>Again, as the system progresses and goes into use, 
        new attributes will need to be added to some of the current tables so the customer is able to collect the specific information 
        needed for his business to be successful. Again, over time as cars, vehicles, and roadways advance additional information will need to be 
        collected</li>
      <li><b>Analytics on cloud database: </b>One future enhancement our customer mentioned to our team early in the semester is he hopes to one 
        day be able to analyze the data collected from accidents and make observations from it. For example, by analyzing the data our 
        customer may observe that numerous accidents occur on Main Street at a specific intersection on rainy nights. Our customer will 
        then be able to provide that information to law enforcement so that the roadway can be analyzed to see if there are any specific issues 
        causing the accidents that can be fixed. By running analytics on the cloud, our customer will be able to determine not only how 
        accidents are occurring but why and how future incidents can be prevented.</li>
      <li><b>New queries built for desktop and mobile teams: </b>As the desktop and mobile applications advance and add new features, the 
        database team will need to aid in the future development of these queries to ensure mobile and desktop can properly access the data 
        and receive the specific information they want.</li>
      <li><b>Insert the accident history from the past 20 years into the database: </b>Early in the semester our customer mentioned that one 
        end goal he had in mind for his system was that he wanted to use the accident history from the past 20 years in the greater Cincinnati 
        area (as this info has been collected and is stored on a Government server) as a starting point for his cloud database. Finding 
        a way to move all this data into the cloud would give the company a great starting point from a data collection standpoint.</li>
      <li><b>Create a method that permits an easy update of database (IE Vehicle Database) annually or as updates become available to the company:
        </b>A stretch goal provided by our customer early in the semester, this would allow for the database to easily be updated as new models
        are developed and released on an annual basis. This most likely can be accomplished using MySQL workbench which was used to push 
        all initial vehicle data into the cloud. However, a sound-proof method in and of itself was not developed for future updates to the
        system. </li>
      <li><b>The advancements of security protocols to ensure data is kept secure: </b>Currently our team only allows access to data if 
        the user inserts the correct password (from mobile and desktop sides). However, as the system progresses and goes into use, new 
        security features may need to be added for additional layers of protection. </li>
    </ul>
