    <h1>Dillon Pulliam's Weekly Activity on Project 10</h1>

    <h3>February 5, 2018 - February 11, 2018</h3>

    <p>
      This week our 4 person group split our work into two smaller projects. One group, consisting
      of Ryan and Daniel, focused on designing an early stage layout of the database with some of
      the tables and corresponding attributes to present to our customer. While Ryan and Daniel went
      about doing this, Alex and I focused on developing the course webpage as the Introduction section
      and the first part of the Requirements section were due on Friday, February 9th. In order
      to develop the course webpage, Alex and I first did a research on hosting webpages
      through github with the github pages feature. As neither Alex nor I had ever hosted a github website
      before, this was a slight learning curve as we had to learn how the system works and how webpages
      are created and hosted from the site.

      After doing research on github pages, Alex and I then went about developing the course
      webpage. I have done some minor website development in the past so I began on the webpage and designed
      our initial index page as well as all the links to locally hosted pages that are accessed from
      it (such as the Introduction page, the Requirements page, the Design page, etc...). Along with
      develpoing the main page and the links to these pages, I also created a stylescript (CSS file) and linked it
      into all pages on our website so that we can do some basic styling. As the semester
      goes along, we will add more styling elements to our page which will add to the readability and
      visual appeal.

      Along with developing the main index page of the website and linking in all other secondary pages
      that are accessed from it, Alex and I also typed up the introduction page to our product to explain it
      more thoughroughly to others. We also constructed the requirements page based on input from meetings
      with our customer and the goals he wants accomplished as part of the project.

      Other than developing the webpage, one other thing our group did this week was a "Google Hangout"
      meeting with our customer. Overall this meeting went very well. Our group
      discussed the progress we made and went over the database layout constructed with the customer to get input
      from them. In this meeting we also compared and discussed the pros and cons of Microsoft
      Azure cloud database system versus the Amazon AWS cloud system. As it appears the Microsft cloud is cheaper,
      our group will probably try to design for this system first. Other than this, we talked about
      security matters and how the databse can be designed to only allow ceratin users to access ceratin tables
      and what users can edit information in the database. Overall, our meeting went very
      well and was successful. We plan to continue meeting with our customer once a week, typically through
      Google Hangouts for the near future!
