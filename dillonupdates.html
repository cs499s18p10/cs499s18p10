	    <h1>Dillon Pulliam's Weekly Activity on Project 10</h1>


	    <h3>February 5, 2018 - February 11, 2018</h3>


	    <p>
	      This week our 4 person group split our work into two smaller projects. One group, consisting
	      of Ryan and Daniel, focused on designing an early stage layout of the database with some of
	      the tables and corresponding attributes to present to our customer. While Ryan and Daniel went
	      about doing this, Alex and I focused on developing the course webpage as the Introduction section
	      and the first part of the Requirements section were due on Friday, February 9th. In order
	      to develop the course webpage, Alex and I first did a research on hosting webpages
	      through github with the github pages feature. As neither Alex nor I had ever hosted a github website
	      before, this was a slight learning curve as we had to learn how the system works and how webpages
	      are created and hosted from the site.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      After doing research on github pages, Alex and I then went about developing the course
	      webpage. I have done some minor website development in the past so I began on the webpage and designed
	      our initial index page as well as all the links to locally hosted pages that are accessed from
	      it (such as the Introduction page, the Requirements page, the Design page, etc...). Along with
	      developing the main page and the links to these pages, I also created a style-script (CSS file) and linked it
	      into all pages on our website so that we can do some basic styling. As the semester
	      goes along, we will add more styling elements to our page which will add to the readability and
	      visual appeal.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Along with developing the main index page of the website and linking in all other secondary pages
	      that are accessed from it, Alex and I also typed up the introduction page to our product to explain it
	      more in depth to others. We also constructed the requirements page based on input from meetings
	      with our customer and the goals he wants accomplished as part of the project.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Other than developing the webpage, one other thing our group did this week was a "Google Hangout"
	      meeting with our customer. Overall this meeting went very well. Our group
	      discussed the progress we made and went over the database layout constructed with the customer to get input
	      from them. In this meeting we also compared and discussed the pros and cons of Microsoft
	      Azure cloud database system versus the Amazon AWS cloud system. As it appears the Microsoft cloud is cheaper,
	      our group will probably try to design for this system first. Other than this, we talked about
	      security matters and how the database can be designed to only allow certain users to access certain tables
	      and what users can edit information in the database. Overall, our meeting went very
	      well and was successful. We plan to continue meeting with our customer once a week, typically through
	      Google Hangouts for the near future!
	    </p>

	    <h3>February 12, 2018 - February 18, 2018</h3>

	    <p>
	      This week I worked on updating the group website as well as researching the differences between Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure.
	      One update made to the website was fixing some errors and adding in new information with regards to what was submitted last week.
	      For example, this week we changed around everything with regards to Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS and made it clear that AWS is the
	      system we have decided to go with. I also implemented the website calendar feature that lays out how we plan to organize our time
	      throughout the remainder of the semester to complete the project and all of its requirements. I worked with Alex
	      to come up with a plan regarding actual scheduling, this involved estimating how long each requirement would take and building the
	      effort and size estimation portion of the website.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Another thing I did this week was research Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure and help decide on which platform to go with. After
	      some debate and coordination with our customer, we eventually decided to go with the Amazon AWS system. This decision was made due to
	      ease of use (there are many online tutorials available and help forms that describe how a relational database can be designed)
	      and added security features (down the road Mike will have the opportunity to closely monitor traffic into and out of his cloud database
	      by adding an extra layer of security offered by Amazon). Our group also met with Mike this past Thursday to communicate these decisions
	      which he agreed on. In this meeting we reviewed the ER Diagrams and Relational Schemas designed by Daniel and Ryan and checked
	      to make sure they agreed with what our customer was looking for. Overall it was again another productive week!
	    </p>

	     <h3>February 19, 2018 - February 25, 2018</h3>

	     <p>
		This week I reviewed the instance of our AWS cloud database created by Alex and Ryan to ensure it lined up
		with our plans in the ER Diagram that we had established with the customer. I also familiarized myself with the
		using the AWS service as and creating databases, tables, and attributes as it is the basis the rest of our project
		will be built on. Other than this I reviewed SQL commands from an earlier database course to prepare for our meeting
		on Monday with the other 2 Delta V Innovations teams.
	     </p>

	      <p>
		In Monday's meeting we plan to meet with the customer as well as the other two database teams to ensure that we are all on
		the same page going forward. During this meeting we also plan to establish communications protocols that can be used going
		forward to ensure that the app can communicate with the mobile and desktop applications.
	      </p>

	      <h3>February 26, 2018 - March 4, 2018</h3>

	      <p>
					This week I spent a majority of my time working on the Power-Point for our presentation on Monday, March
					3rd. I also spent some time working on the "Designs" section of the project webpage. For the Power-Point we
					used "Google Slides" which allowed access and editing power to all group members. This is a powerful tool
					as it allows access in real-time to everyone. In fact, multiple people can even edit the presentation at
					the same time. Overall, I did a majority of the Power-Point design laying out	how the presentation would
					flow as well as what words and images people will see as we present.

	      </p>

	      <p>
					Other than the Power-Point for our Midterm presentation, I also worked on the “Designs”, “User Screens”,
					and “User Scenarios” portions of the project website. For this part of the website I did the website
					layout, documentation, and design while my teammates provided the diagrams going onto the site. Some of
					the diagrams we have added (or plan to add!) are the ER Diagram and Relational Schema of our database
					layout and direct	screen shots within our AWS Relational Database page. We also will add a flow chart
					where we lay out the entire process behind accessing the database at the crash scene through the mobile
					application, uploading data and images to it,	and then accessing this information back at base through
					the desktop application.
       </p>

	      <p>
					Overall, our group again had a very productive week. We met on Monday, February 26th with our customer
					and members of the mobile and desktop application teams. This meeting was very helpful in terms of making
					sure everyone was on the same page with our customer and his expectations. In this meeting we were also
					able to lay out a plan for what we want to accomplish next in terms of the overall scheme of the project.
					This week we also were able to upload the first actual data to our database using a conversion method from
					Excel file types to AWS Relational Databases. Other than these two achievements, most of our work this week
					focused on preparing for the Midterm Presentation (which we practiced on Wednesday, February 28th at
					PresentationU) and updating our project	website.
	      </p>


	<h3>March 5, 2018 - March 18, 2018</h3>

	<p>
		Over spring break I didn’t focus very heavily on this project. I was in St. Louis, Missouri for the SEC tournament for 
		5 days right before midterm and then Boise, Idaho for another 5 days over spring break. One thing I did accomplish over 
		the break is I added more in-depth details for the “Environment” portion of the website to aid in future development and 
		testing for other groups per the instructor’s request.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		As our group comes back from the break we plan to start testing immediately and ensure communication can occur between 
		the mobile and desktop applications and our cloud database. This will be priority number one going forward as this is 
		crucial for proper operation. After testing these communication protocols, we will then go about designing the SQL 
		commands that will be needed for the applications to pull and push the proper information / data to the cloud. As we 
		currently have the actual database set up, and even some of the actual data stored in it, I believe we are in good 
		shape to finish out the project and complete the goals laid out for our group from our customer!  
	</p>
		  
	<h3>March 19, 2018 - March 25, 2018</h3>
		  
	<p>
		Over the past week I have primarily been focused with helping to develop a test plan for our project. In terms of the 
		test plan, we have been tasked with designing for the following categories: unit testing, integration/function testing, 
		system testing, and customer/user testing. Designing the test plan has been slightly more difficult for our project 
		than for the typical project. This is because our project is one sub-project of a larger three team project. 
		Therefore, although the unit testing can be done within our own group, the integration/function testing, system testing, 
		and customer/user testing must be combined with the other two Delta V Innovations teams.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is especially true because our project, the cloud database portion of the system, is a back-end system that helps 
		the other two projects function and operate successfully. Therefore, the SQL code, commands, and queries that are used 
		to send/receive information to/from the database are contained within the mobile and desktop application systems. So, 
		for higher level testing, we must work with the other two groups to ensure their systems are ready to be tested in 
		specific ways. This has added extra layers of difficulty to designing our test plan as it has required communication 
		between teams and a synchronized plan to test all three systems concurrently.     
	</p>
		  
	<h3>March 16, 2018 - April 1, 2018</h3>
		
	<p>
		Over the past week I focused primarily on completing the test plan that we began building last week. For the unit testing
		portion of the plan, we laid out how our database can be build in myUK or any other open-source relational 
		database software system. This was helpful as it makes querying the database much easier than querying the actual cloud itself. 
		Using an open source software to build the identical database to the cloud one is nice as it allowed our group to test 
		various SQL commands to both send and retrieve information from the cloud. Consequently, we could nail down the correct 
		syntax for our SQL commands so they can be copied into the software of both mobile and desktop when the front in is ready 
		connect with the backend. 
	</p>
		  
	<p>
		For the integration / function testing portion of the plan I have constructed various SQL queries / commands needed by 
		both mobile and desktop execution. These are more advanced commands then the ones laid out in the unit testing portion of 
		plan. These commands show how mobile can insert information into various tables and how desktop can retrieve car specs, 
		case information, and various data needed for proper execution. For the final portion of the plan I developed the system 
		testing portion. In this part of the plan I have described how the commands developed in the integration / function portion 
		of the test plan can be coded into the mobile and desktop applications. I then describe how the overall system can be tested 
		to ensure that mobile can properly send information to the cloud and how desktop can then retrieve that info from the cloud 
		into their application. 
	</p>
		  
	<p>
		Although developing the test plan portion of the project was my primary focus over the past week or so I also achieved a few other 
		things. On Friday, we met with our customer through "Google Hangouts" to describe how the project was going and some issues we were 
		having with connecting to mobile. During this meeting we brainstormed how the connection issues could be solved and the steps we 
		could take. I also built a replica of our cloud database onto my own personal laptop using the open-source MySQL software. This 
		allowed me to test building the database and its tables, inserting information into the tables, and querying the tables to retrieve 
		a variety of different information. Overall I beleive I had a very successful week and was able to get a lot of goals accomplished!
