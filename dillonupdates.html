	    <h1>Dillon Pulliam's Weekly Activity on Project 10</h1>
	

	    <h3>February 5, 2018 - February 11, 2018</h3>
	

	    <p>
	      This week our 4 person group split our work into two smaller projects. One group, consisting
	      of Ryan and Daniel, focused on designing an early stage layout of the database with some of
	      the tables and corresponding attributes to present to our customer. While Ryan and Daniel went
	      about doing this, Alex and I focused on developing the course webpage as the Introduction section
	      and the first part of the Requirements section were due on Friday, February 9th. In order
	      to develop the course webpage, Alex and I first did a research on hosting webpages
	      through github with the github pages feature. As neither Alex nor I had ever hosted a github website
	      before, this was a slight learning curve as we had to learn how the system works and how webpages
	      are created and hosted from the site.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      After doing research on github pages, Alex and I then went about developing the course
	      webpage. I have done some minor website development in the past so I began on the webpage and designed
	      our initial index page as well as all the links to locally hosted pages that are accessed from
	      it (such as the Introduction page, the Requirements page, the Design page, etc...). Along with
	      developing the main page and the links to these pages, I also created a style-script (CSS file) and linked it
	      into all pages on our website so that we can do some basic styling. As the semester
	      goes along, we will add more styling elements to our page which will add to the readability and
	      visual appeal.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Along with developing the main index page of the website and linking in all other secondary pages
	      that are accessed from it, Alex and I also typed up the introduction page to our product to explain it
	      more in depth to others. We also constructed the requirements page based on input from meetings
	      with our customer and the goals he wants accomplished as part of the project.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Other than developing the webpage, one other thing our group did this week was a "Google Hangout"
	      meeting with our customer. Overall this meeting went very well. Our group
	      discussed the progress we made and went over the database layout constructed with the customer to get input
	      from them. In this meeting we also compared and discussed the pros and cons of Microsoft
	      Azure cloud database system versus the Amazon AWS cloud system. As it appears the Microsoft cloud is cheaper,
	      our group will probably try to design for this system first. Other than this, we talked about
	      security matters and how the database can be designed to only allow certain users to access certain tables
	      and what users can edit information in the database. Overall, our meeting went very
	      well and was successful. We plan to continue meeting with our customer once a week, typically through
	      Google Hangouts for the near future!
	    </p>
	    
	    <h3>February 12, 2018 - February 18, 2018</h3>
	    
	    <p>
	      This week I worked on updating the group website as well as researching the differences between Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure.
	      One update made to the website was fixing some errors and adding in new information with regards to what was submitted last week.
	      For example, this week we changed around everything with regards to Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS and made it clear that AWS is the 
	      system we have decided to go with. I also implemented the website calendar feature that lays out how we plan to organize our time
	      throughout the remainder of the semester to complete the project and all of its requirements. I worked with Alex
	      to come up with a plan regarding actual scheduling, this involved estimating how long each requirement would take and building the 
	      effort and size estimation portion of the website. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Another thing I did this week was research Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure and help decide on which platform to go with. After 
	      some debate and coordination with our customer, we eventually decided to go with the Amazon AWS system. This decision was made due to
	      ease of use (there are many online tutorials available and help forms that describe how a relational database can be designed)
	      and added security features (down the road Mike will have the opportunity to closely monitor traffic into and out of his cloud database 
	      by adding an extra layer of security offered by Amazon). Our group also met with Mike this past Thursday to communicate these decisions
	      which he agreed on. In this meeting we reviewed the ER Diagrams and Relational Schemas designed by Daniel and Ryan and checked 
	      to make sure they agreed with what our customer was looking for. Overall it was again another productive week!
