    <h1>User Scenarios</h1>
    <p>For the broader project, use cases and user scenarios will be split into two categories: interactions with the mobile application and desktop application. Either private investigators or institutional investigators (perhaps a police officer) will use the mobile application at a crash site to capture images of the crash, take notes, and record relevant information like weather. Then, the investigator or his or her team can use the desktop application for analysis of the data, and, eventually, crash recreation. </p>
    <p>However, our group is only one part of the broader project: the database. Therefore, in a sense, our users are the mobile and desktop application, and our job is giving them the ability to easily access and edit the database, without ever altering the structure of the database itself. This was accomplished by creating a MySQL database in AWSâ€™s Relational Database Services, and allowing the desktop and mobile applications to perform one of the following actions using SQL commands:</p>
    <h3>1.	Searching (Querying) the database to retrieve information</h3>
    <p>When a user on the mobile or desktop application wishes to access information from a certain case, that 
    information must be pulled from the cloud. This is done using basic SQL commands.</p>
    <p>The mobile or desktop program will receive text or a menu selection for what data is being summoned. Then, the program
    can use SQL commands to query and get whatever data is necessary.
    <h3>2.	Writing to the database to upload information</h3>
    <p>When a user on the mobile application arrives at the scene of the crash, they will gather
    data to eventually upload to their new case number within the application. Once the data is ready for upload,
    simple SQL commands can upload plain text, numbers, or image files.</p>
    <h3>3.	Deleting a piece of information from the database</h3>
    <p>At times, data may need to be removed from the database. Perhaps an officer realizes his or her notes are innacurate,
    or that they uploaded an image of poor quality. In such a situation, they will want to delete such data. Luckily,
    our database can easily handle this, allowing for removal of data from tables within the database using SQL commands.</p>
    <h3>Example SQL Commands:</h3>
      A simple select command that selects every piece of data in the User table:
      <br>SELECT * FROM User;<br>
          
      <br>A simple insert command that will insert the values value1,value2,value3 into the table Workgroup:<br>
      INSERT INTO Workgroup
      VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...); <br>
    
      <br>A simple Delete command that deletes data from the 'case' table where condition is present:<br>
      DELETE FROM case
      WHERE condtion;<br>
    
      <br>A simple update command that updates the Occuppant_info table and will set the columns to the value of 1 where condition is present:<br>
      UPDATE Occupant_info
      SET column1 = good
      WHERE condition; 
    <p></p>
