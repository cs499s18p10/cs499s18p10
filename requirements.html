    <h1>Requirements</h1>
   
   <h3><i>Priority Order of Requirements</i></h3>
    <p><b>1. Have a database within the cloud</b><br>
      The primary goal of the project is to have a database stored within the cloud. This will allow for database communication with 
      all systems neccessary for essential crash scene investigation.
    </p>
    <p><b>2. Internet Communication protocols to the desktop software and mobile device for data sent to clients, adn storage of data 
      recieved from clients</b><br>
      Communication protocals must be established to ensure that data can be sent from mobile devices in the field and properly stored
      in the cloud database. Additionally, communication protocals must also be developed for the desktop aplication side allowing it to
      properly communicate with the cloud application and pull essential crash scene information needed for scene development.
    </p>
    <p><b>3. Database created with typical tables and/or fields needed for data for the initial functions to be developed</b><br>
      The cloud database must be created and developed with initial relational tables and their essential corresponding attributes being 
      designed. Note that as the project progresses more and more tables and the overall schema behind the database will most likely 
      change.
    </p>
    <p><b>4. SQL table updates to insert initial data</b><br>
      The team will have access to crash scene data from the past 20 years from the Cincinnati area as guaranteed from the customer. 
      SQL queries must be developed to ensure this data can accurately and securely be transferred from these servers to the cloud
      database. Additionally, the customer has a series of tables with friction gradients, car information, etc. that must be uploaded
      to the cloud database. SQL queries to transfer this information from the current format to the cloud database must be designed.
    </p>
    <p><b>5. SQL queries for data for the first functions to be developed</b><br>
      SQL queries must be designed that allow for the first functions of the mobile and desktop applications to be tested. This queries
      will function by using the communication protocols established in step 2. to send data from the mobile app to the cloud server and 
      consequently pull information from the cloud server to the desktop application. Initial SQL queries must be designed to ensure 
      information is stored and accessed accurately, quickly, and effeciently. 
    </p>
    <p><b>6. Security protocols to restrict access to data and programs (starting with user ID and password)</b><br>
      Security protocols must be designed to ensure that the proper users/individuals have access to only the neccessary data 
      they need to perform their duties. Protocols must also be develped to ensure updates or changes to the database cannot be 
      made without the proper access clearences. 
    </p>
    <p><b>7. Other initial functions viewed as important by the customer</b><br>
      <i>a.</i> Create a method that permits an easy update of database (IE Vehicle Database) annually or as updates become available to the 
      company. <br>
      <i>b.</i> As database updates are installed, allow for pushing of data back to the mobile and desktop applications.
