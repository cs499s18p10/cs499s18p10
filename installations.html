      Our project implemented a cloud-based database that will serve as a storage facility for the mobile and desktop applications. We used Amazon Web Service to host
      our database. Initially, we had our customer create an account through Amazon that would allow us to create an instance of the database. There are several tools that would help utilize the AWS database in HeidiSQL and MySQL workbench.</p>
    <p>The links below will guide you to the installation pages of each tool.</p>
